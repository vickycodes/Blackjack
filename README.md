# **JS | Blackjack**

## Introduction

In project week 1, as part of the Ironhack Web development bootcamp, we programmed a game.
I decided on the game "Blackjack", in order to put my newly attained into action.

Within this project I applied and made use of as many topics that we have learned in the first two weeks of the course, such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and some bootstrapping.


## Setup



## Rules of the game

The goal of the Black Jack game is simple - you want to get as close to the value of 21 as possible and beat the dealer.
When a new game starts the player gets 2 cards immediately as well as the dealer , yet the dealer's second card is hidden.
Once the player decides to "stand" or he/she lost the game the dealers total card value will be visible.

Some other basic rules:

- All cards from 2 to 10 are added at their face value
- King, Queen and Jack cards have a value of 10 when they are added
- The Ace card can either have a value of 1 or 11.
- When the dealer hits a total of 17 he is not allowed to "hit" anymore (in this case it's the computer)
- when a total of 21 is hit - It's Black Jack! and the game is won.
- Even if 21 os not attained, the player/dealer closest to 21 wins.
- If the total card values are identical then it's a tie.

Enjoy the Game!!
